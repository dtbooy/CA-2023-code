   implement a Vehicle class. It should accept make and model properties 
   when you create an object.

civic = Vehicle("Honda", "Civic")

    Implement a Car class. It should inherit from Vehicle.

civic = Car("Honda", "Civic")

    Implement a Motorbike class. It should also inherit from Vehicle.

low_rider = Motorbike("Harley Davidson", "Low Rider")

    Implement the following methods, but first decide where they should live.

    refuel (should take one argument: litres)
    wheelie (should display a message)
    wind_up_windows (should display a message)
    fuel_level (should display total litres in the tank)

ADVANCED

    A car should only allow maximum 50L of petrol and a bike 15L. Keep your code DRY!

civic = Car("Honda", "Civic")
civic.fuel_level # -> 0L in the tank
civic.refuel(10)
civic.fuel_level # -> 10L in the tank
civic.refuel(10)
civic.fuel_level # -> 20L in the tank
civic.refuel(100)
civic.fuel_level # -> 50L in the tank

Implement a travel method that takes a distance in km as a parameter 
and adjusts the fuel_level according to the km per litre of the vehicle. 
Return the actual distance travelled, which will be less than the requested 
distance if they ran out of fuel.
